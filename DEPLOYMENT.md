# Production Deployment Guide

## Current Architecture (Recommended)

Your project already has an excellent architecture:

```
Frontend (Next.js) → Port 3000
Backend (Express.js) → Port 4000
```

## Development

```bash
npm run de  # Runs both frontend and backend
```

## Production Options

### Option 1: Separate Deployment (Recommended)

**Frontend:**

```bash
npm run build    # Build Next.js app
npm run start    # Start production Next.js server (port 3000)
```

**Backend:**

```bash
cd backend
npm start        # Start Express API server (port 4000)
```

### Option 2: Docker Deployment

Create `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  frontend:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://backend:4000
    depends_on:
      - backend

  backend:
    build: ./backend
    ports:
      - "4000:4000"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
```

### Option 3: Vercel + Railway/Heroku

**Frontend:** Deploy to Vercel
**Backend:** Deploy to Railway, Heroku, or DigitalOcean

## Environment Variables

**Frontend (.env.local):**

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend-api.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_DOMAIN=https://your-backend-api.com
```

**Backend (.env):**

```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=4000
DB_HOST=your-database-host
DB_USER=your-database-user
DB_PASS=your-database-password
```

## Why NOT Use Hybrid Server

The hybrid Express + Next.js approach you tried has these issues:

1. **Complexity:** Harder to maintain and debug
2. **Routing Conflicts:** Express and Next.js routes can interfere
3. **Build Issues:** Next.js expects specific file structures
4. **Scalability:** Harder to scale frontend and backend independently
5. **Deployment:** More complex deployment process

## Fixing Current Build Issues

The build failures are due to React Context SSR issues, not architecture problems. These need to be fixed regardless of deployment method.

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Keep current development setup (it works great!)
2. Fix the React Context SSR issues for production builds
3. Use separate deployment for frontend and backend
4. Configure proper environment variables
5. Use a reverse proxy (nginx) in production if needed
